# xchange-arbitrage 

This project leverages the Bitfinex public API to identify arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency markets. 
By implementing the [Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm), 
the system detects negative-weight cycles in the graph representation of currency exchange rates, 
which signal profitable arbitrage opportunities.

Designed for educational purpose, this project showcases the application of graph theory
in real-world financial scenarios. It features a modular structure, making it easy to extend
or adapt for other APIs or financial markets.
